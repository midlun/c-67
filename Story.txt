STORY
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a banyan tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest lived a crocodile and crocodile's wife.
One day, the crcodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As the days passed by, the crcodile and the monkey became goood friends.
